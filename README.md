# The old G-EDM EVOII CAD files are still available here:
They don't open with FreeCAD 1.0.0 and to open them it requires a FreeCAD version < 1.0.0. Something like 0.2x or something.</br>

# G-EDM EVOIII

Github does not allow large files. The FreeCAD (1.0.0) project for the brand new EVOIII router can be found here:

The EVOIII router is an all in one solution with integrated electronics, a more lightweight frame and a reduction in print material. 
The new wire module is less complicated to build, easier to wire and uses a modified version of the belt driven wire feeder designed by Alex Treseder for the PICO:

</br>

</br>
</br>

At this point the EVOIII router is just a concept. The new wire module seems to be ok but I haven't build the full router yet and can't promise that everything works.
</br>

This router uses HGR15 linear rails instead of the chunky HGR20 rails. Possible that the slot 8 profiles may not combine well with the small HGR15 rails. Needs further testing.

# Connecting the TTL interface from the DPM or DPH to the motionboard

    There are two motionboard. EVOII and in the future the EVOIII board
    The EVOII board has RX and TX swapped. The EVOIII has it in the correct order mirroring the output terminal
    on the DPM and DPH.
