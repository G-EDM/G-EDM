# The old G-EDM EVOII CAD files are still available here:
They don't open with FreeCAD 1.0.0 and to open them it requires a FreeCAD version < 1.0.0. Something like 0.2x or something.</br>

# G-EDM EVOIII

Github does not allow large files. The FreeCAD (1.0.0) project for the brand new EVOIII router can be found here:

At this point the EVOIII router is just a concept. The new wire module seems to be ok but I haven't build the full router yet and can't promise that everything works.
</br>

This router uses HGR15 linear rails instead of the chunky HGR20 rails. Possible that the slot 8 profiles may not combine well with the small HGR15 rails. Needs further testing.
