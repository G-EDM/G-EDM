# G-EDM EVOIII

Github does not allow large files. The FreeCAD project for the router can be found here:

At this point the EVOIII router is just a concept. The new wire module seems to be ok but I haven't build the full router yet and can't promise that everything works.

This router uses HGR15 linear rails instead of the chunky HGR20 rails. Possible that the slot 8 profiles may not combine well with the small HGR15 rails. Needs further testing.
